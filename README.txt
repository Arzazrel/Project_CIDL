Folder of the Ifrit application, an AI application that implement a CNN model built in Python for the Computational Intelligence and Deep Learning project at the University of Pisa.

The dataset used for the application can be found on kaggle at the following link: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohnishsaiprasad/forest-fire-images

The folder contains:
 - 3 python files: Fire_cls_GUI (main file, GUI), AlexNet_class, GoogLeNet class
 - Dataset folder: contains 5050 jpg images
 - Model folder: contains the model of CNN already trained and ready to use
 - Others folder: for future implementations, utilitys or CNN experiments in Python
 - Documentation: documentation regarding the application and the analysis carried out for the choice of model and parameters. (WILL BE ADDED AT THE END OF THE PROJECT)

Procedure for use:

    run 'Fire_cls_GUI' file
